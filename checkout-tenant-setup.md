The Deposits One-Click Checkout allows allows merchants to quickly enroll, onboard, and checkout customers. We provide powerful Web and Mobile SDK for you.

  

## Setup
You have to first create an account on our console, we advise you do so on our sandbox environment first to enable you understand and play around with the SDK and APIs.

Deposits Console URL in sandbox
```sh
https://console.deposits.dev/client-admin/login
```
DepositsConsole URL in production

```

##### First steps in the console

1. Login/Register on the console, if you do register you would need to verify your account.

2. Click on the Add Client button on the dashboard, fill the form and submit, In Sandbox your tenant will be automatically approved but in production our business and compliance team will review before approving.
3. On the dashboard click on view to open the client page.
